Application: My Favorite Restaurant

This application allows users to find popular restaurants based on location and add their favorite restaurants to the database for others to find.Users can sign up and login to add their favorite restaurants to the database. Jqueryvalidation engine has been used for error checking. Google maps api has been used to implement search and validate addresses filled by the user before submitting to the database.

Features
Find popular restaurants
Add favorite restaurants to the database 

Note: The app is working fine on local server but the markers are not showing up on the live server.
It probably has to do something with Regional and Language settings on the web server. I am not able to find a way to change the settings on the web server. I posted the question on Piazza but did not get any response.
